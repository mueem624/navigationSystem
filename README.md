(3) The GPS Sensor functionality getCurrentPosition() is simulated by manually entering a position via the keyboard.

(4) CNavigationSystem::enterRoute(): Add some POI’s and waypoints to your route. You may create your own trip.

(5) CNavigationSystem::printRoute(): Print all POI’s and Waypoints of your route.

(6) CNavigationSystem::printDistanceCurPosNextPoi(): Get the current position from the GPS sensor and search for the closest Point of Interest.

(7) CPoiDatabase::getPointerToPoi(string name): Searches for a POI with the provided name and returns a pointer to this POI.

(8) The behavior of the other methods should be pretty obvious.
